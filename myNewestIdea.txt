MY NEWEST IDEA:

PROJECT HOUSER -> Priority 1:
1. GET input for the place where house is.
2. GET data on sq.ft of the house
3. GET the city of house
4. GET price 

5. SEARCH magicbricks.com
6. SEND correct data.
7. FIND the house which is near the price given in STEP 4
8. WRITE an file with the link and necessary details
9. END
